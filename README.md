# Project Title

Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview

This project involves predicting whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. It's a classic beginner project with readily available data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

### Features

- `Pclass`: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger
- `Age`: Age of the passenger
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings or spouses aboard
- `Parch`: Number of parents or children aboard
- `Fare`: Ticket fare
- `Cabin`: Cabin number
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

### Target Variable

- `Survived`: Binary variable (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)

## Code

The project code is written in Python using popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

### Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values
- Dropping unnecessary columns
- Converting categorical variables to numerical form

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualizing feature distributions
- Exploring relationships between features and survival

### Model Building

- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Feature scaling
- Training a Random Forest Classifier

### Model Evaluation

- Accuracy score
- Classification report
- Confusion matrix
- ROC Curve and Precision-Recall Curve
